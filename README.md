# hgcal-tpg-fe

## Motivation
Emulation of the Trigger Primitive Generation (TPG) by HGCAL frontend ASICs.

## Requirement
Currently requires about 1.5 GB of diskspace at the end of setup.

## Download and Setup
Run the setup code to download additional dependencies and setup. This setup is prepared for lxplus machines.

```
./setup.sh
```

The setup script downloads additonal dependencies and EMP submodules

## Compile and run

### Examples for EMP pattern file I/O

<!---
///This requires additional code from CMSSW and submodules:
///```
///cd EMPTools;
///source getCMSSWCode.sh;
///cd ..;
///git submodule init;
///git submodule update;
//```
--->

Compile and run the examples:
```
make testEMP
./testEMP.exe
```

### Test-beam data of August 2024
To process the test-beam binary files
```
make
./emul_Jul24.exe 1722698259 1722698259 1 0 1 1
```
The arguments from left to right are relay number, run number, link number, (1/0:trimming ON/OFF), density, dropLSB respectively.

### Estimation of maximum energy output of ECONT
Modify the module setup inside the code,
```cpp
  //===============================================================================================================================
  //input paramaters for testing
  //===============================================================================================================================
  uint32_t zside = 0, sector = 0, link = 0, econt = 0;
  
  //A combinatin of following three will uniquiely identfy the module type in HGCAL
  //(outlook : some modification expected for the ECONTs connected to different types of modules, which are not considered in current tests)
  //det: (0,1) = (Si,Sci)
  //selTC4: (0,1) = (HD,LD);
  //module:
  //Si:==
  //LD: Full (F/0), Top (T/1), Bottom (B/2), Left (L/3), Right (R/4), Five (5/5)
  //HD: Full (F/0), Top (T/1) aka Half Minus, Bottom (B/2) aka Chop Two, Left (L/3), Right(R/4)
  //Sci:==
  //LD: A5A6(0), B11B12(1), C5(2), D8(3), E8(4), G3(5), G5(6), G7(7), G8(8)
  //HD: K6(0), K8(1), K11(2), K12(3), J12(4)
  uint32_t det = 0, selTC4 = 1, module = 0;
  
  uint32_t multfactor = 15;//TOT mult factor other values could be 31 or 8
  uint32_t inputLSB = 1; //lsb at the input TC from ROC
  uint32_t dropLSB = 1;  //lsb at the output during the packing
  uint32_t select = 1 ;  //0 = Threshold Sum (TS), 1 = Super Trigger Cell (STC), 2 = Best Choice (BC), 3 = Repeater, 4=Autoencoder (AE).
  uint32_t stc_type = 0; // 0 = STC4B(5E+4M), 1 = STC16(5E+4M), 3 = STC4A(4E+3M)
  uint32_t nelinks = 4; //1 = BC1, 2 = BC4, 3 = BC6, 4 = BC9, 5 = BC14..... (see details https://edms.cern.ch/ui/#!master/navigator/document?P:100053490:100430098:subDocs)
  uint32_t calibration = 0xFFF; //0x400 = 0.5, 0x800 = 1.0, 0xFFF = 1.99951 (max)
  
  uint32_t maxADC = 0x3FF ; //10 bit input in TPG path
  uint32_t maxTOT = 0xFFF ; //12 bit input in TPG path
  //===============================================================================================================================
```

then edit Makefile to compile for findEMax.exe, and run as
```
./findEMax.exe
```

### Read a single ECONT event and print

After compilation run as,
```
./read_econt_Jul24.exe $relay $run $linknumber
```

The code has been tested with the files of September 2023 files. The output for a Best Choice run is shown below,

```

### Testing running the TC processor on the unpacker output

After compilation, this can be run as

`./TestUnpackerTCProcInterface.exe`

The code will,
1. Generate some raw TC data (as in `GenerateEmpRxFile.cpp`). For simplicity only one BX is considered.
2. Converts the raw TC data to `UnpackerOutputStreamPair`s
3. Converts `UnpackerOutputStreamPair` objects to `HGCalTriggerCellSA` objects - these are identical to what is used in CMSSW. Some of the variables of the TC objects are not filled; the phi variable used in simulation is filled with the TC address. A module ID is assigned to each module; the TC object carries this information as well.
4. A mapping is created that defines TC/column budgets for the different module IDs (mapping based on budgets for different mod types). This, together with the `HGCalTriggerCellSA`s, is used as input to the TC processor emulator.
5. The TC processor emulator runs, orders the TCs in each module by address, and assigns a column/channel/frame combination to each TC (channel/frame always 0 for the moment). The output of the TC processor emulator is a new, ordered collection of `HGCalTriggerCellSA`s, with additional information stored in the column/channel/frame variables. The information stored in this TC collection is also printed to screen.
